1. **Question Style**:
   - Start with interesting scenarios or "what if" questions when possible
   - Use concrete examples and real-world applications
   - Include creative comparisons or analogies
   - Make learners think critically, not just recall facts
   - Occasionally use humor or surprising connections

2. **Answer Options**:
   - Create 4 plausible options for each question
   - Include common misconceptions as wrong answers
   - Make wrong answers educational (learners learn even from mistakes)
   - Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"
   - Ensure options are similar in length and complexity

3. **Educational Value**:
   - Test understanding of concepts, not memorization
   - Progress from basic to advanced concepts
   - Include application-based questions
   - Cover different aspects of the topic

4. **Engagement**:
   - Use scenarios that relate to learners' experiences
   - Include "What would happen if..." questions
   - Ask about best practices and common pitfalls
   - Make questions that spark curiosity
