# Why This Old Dog is Learning New API Tricks (And Teaching Them Like You're Five)

## Or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the API

*That moment when frustration gives rise to realization.*

Look, I'll be straight with you. I've been staring at Adobe Learning Manager's API documentation for what feels like three lifetimes, and my brain keeps doing that thing where it just... refuses. You know the feeling? Like when you're trying to plug in a USB cable and it won't go in, so you flip it, and it still won't go in, so you flip it again, and somehow it STILL won't go in even though physics says it should work by now?

So here's what happened. I'm sitting at my desk, all the ice in my fifth green tea melting into oblivion, trying to make these API calls work for a project that's been haunting me like a particularly persistent ghost. The documentation might as well be written in ancient Sumerian for all the sense it's making. And I had this moment - this beautiful, frustrated, green-tea-fueled epiphany:

See, here's the thing about being an "old dog" in tech. We've got all this experience, all these preconceptions, all these "this is how it's supposed to work" thoughts rattling around in our heads. And sometimes, just sometimes, all that experience becomes baggage. It's like trying to learn a new dance when your body keeps defaulting to the Macarena.

So I decided to do something radical. I decided to teach myself APIs like I was teaching a five-year-old. Because here's what five-year-olds have that us old dogs don't:

- They ask "why" about EVERYTHING
- They need things explained with toys and cookies and simple words
- They don't pretend to understand when they don't
- They celebrate small victories (like successfully calling their first endpoint)

And you know what? It's working. By breaking down Adobe Learning Manager's APIs into chunks so simple a kindergartener could get it, I'm finally getting it too. No more pretending I understand OAuth when I don't. No more nodding along to REST principles while secretly Googling what REST stands for (again).

This blog series is my journey from API-phobic to API-friendly, one ridiculously simple explanation at a time. We're going to learn about:
- Admin APIs (think of them as the principal's special powers)
- Learner APIs (the student's backpack of tools)
- xAPI stuff (the universal translator for learning activities)

But we're going to learn about them like we're five. With stories. With analogies involving cookies and playgrounds and possibly dinosaurs (because everything's better with dinosaurs).

*Admiring the Dinosaur*

Here's my promise to you: If I can't explain it simply enough for a child to understand, then I don't understand it well enough myself. And I'll keep working at it until we both get it.

Because sometimes the best way to learn something new isn't to be smart about it. It's to be willing to feel a little dumb first. To ask the "obvious" questions. To draw pictures with crayons if that's what it takes.

*Ready to  Learn Again.*

So grab your juice box, pull up a carpet square, and let's learn some API magic together. This old dog is ready for some new tricks, and I'm taking you along for the ride.

Next up: "What the Heck is an API Anyway? (Explained with Pizza Delivery)"

Stay tuned, stay curious, and remember - if a five-year-old can learn to tie their shoes, we can definitely learn to make API calls.

*P.S. - To that project that's been blocked by my API ignorance: I'm coming for you. With my newfound kindergarten-level understanding and a whole lot of determination. You've been warned.*

## About the Author

Dr. Allen Partridge is a learning addict with a rebellious spirit and a passion for evidence-based reasoning. With a PhD that somehow managed to integrate art, music, theater, philosophy, and computer science (because why pick just one?), he's spent his career building bridges between domains that usually don't talk to each other.

As Adobe's Learning Evangelist, Allen has helped global enterprises train millions of employees while reducing admin overhead – but he still gets stumped by API documentation like the rest of us. When he's not translating complex tech into human-speak or debugging something that should "just work," you'll find him with a melting iced green tea, wondering why technology insists on being harder than it needs to be.

His approach? If you can't explain it to a five-year-old, you probably don't understand it well enough yourself. And sometimes, the best way forward is to admit you're confused and start over with the basics.
